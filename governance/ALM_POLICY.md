# MarcoERP – ALM Policy

**Application Lifecycle Management, CI/CD, Quality Gates, and Enforcement Framework**

---

## 1. Purpose

This document defines how MarcoERP code is built, validated, tested, merged, and released.

Governance defines the rules.
ALM enforces them.

No code reaches production without passing ALM gates.

---

## 2. ALM Principles

| Principle ID | Principle |
|--------------|----------|
| ALM-01 | Automation over manual discipline |
| ALM-02 | Build must fail on structural violations |
| ALM-03 | No feature is complete without tests |
| ALM-04 | No deployment without database safety verification |
| ALM-05 | Governance rules must be technically enforceable |
| ALM-06 | Code quality is measured, not assumed |

---

## 3. Continuous Integration (CI) Rules

Every commit to `develop` or `main` triggers automated validation.

### 3.1 Build Validation

Build MUST fail if:

- Circular dependency detected
- Domain references external layer
- Application references Persistence implementation
- Infrastructure references Application
- Missing XML documentation on public members
- Compilation warnings present
- Any test fails

---

### 3.2 Static Code Analysis Rules

The following thresholds are enforced:

| Rule | Limit |
|------|-------|
| Class length | 800 lines (hard fail) |
| Service class length | 500 lines (warning) |
| Method length | 50 lines |
| Cyclomatic complexity | 10 |
| Nesting depth | 3 |
| Public methods per class | 15 |

Violations block merge unless explicitly approved.

---

### 3.3 Architecture Enforcement

Automated checks verify:

- No business logic in WpfUI
- No SQL outside Persistence
- No DateTime.Now usage
- No float/double in financial calculations
- All entities include RowVersion
- All financial entities include soft-delete

---

## 4. Test Enforcement Rules

| Rule ID | Rule |
|---------|------|
| TST-ALM-01 | Domain project must have unit tests before merge |
| TST-ALM-02 | Application services must have mocked repository tests |
| TST-ALM-03 | Posting workflows must have integration test coverage |
| TST-ALM-04 | Minimum coverage threshold: 70% Domain layer |
| TST-ALM-05 | Financial calculation changes require new tests |

Build fails if:

- Coverage drops below threshold
- New domain logic added without test

---

## 5. Branch Protection Rules

### Protected Branches:
- `main`
- `develop`

Direct commits to `main` are forbidden.

### Pull Request Requirements:
- CI must pass
- At least one review (self-review allowed in solo dev with checklist)
- Governance impact section completed

---

## 6. Database Migration Control

Before merging any migration:

- Migration reviewed
- No data-loss operation
- Down() method verified
- Backup confirmation documented
- Naming follows MIG-02 convention

Production deployment requires:

- Pre-deployment backup
- Post-migration verification
- Trial balance validation

---

## 7. Release Quality Gates

Before tagging a release:

- All tests pass
- No critical architecture violations
- No TODO markers in production code
- Version increment validated
- CHANGELOG updated
- Governance documents synchronized

---

## 8. Security Enforcement

Automated checks verify:

- No plain-text passwords
- No sensitive data in logs
- AuthorizationGuard used in Application services
- No UI-only authorization enforcement
- No exposed internal IDs in DTOs

---

## 9. Performance Safeguards

Before release:

- All foreign keys indexed
- No unbounded queries
- No lazy loading enabled
- Large dataset queries paginated
- Retry policy configured

---

## 10. Governance Synchronization

Each phase transition requires:

- Governance review
- Structural health check
- Version bump validation
- Risk assessment review

If governance changes:
- Patch version increment required
- Version history table updated

---

## 11. Deployment Policy

Deployment Steps:

1. Backup database
2. Validate migration scripts
3. Deploy binaries
4. Apply migration
5. Run smoke tests
6. Validate posting workflow
7. Validate trial balance

If failure:
- Immediate rollback to backup
- Root cause analysis
- Patch release required

---

## 12. Technical Debt Logging

All shortcuts must be logged in:

`governance/TECHNICAL_DEBT.md`

Debt must include:
- Description
- Risk level
- Planned resolution phase

Technical debt cannot be ignored silently.

---

## 13. Structural Health Monitoring

Quarterly health check:

- Layer validation
- Complexity report
- Dead code scan
- Unused dependency scan
- Governance compliance review

Red flags trigger immediate refactoring cycle.

---

## 14. Enforcement Authority

Violation of ALM rules is a development blocker.

If ALM and other governance conflict,
PROJECT_RULES.md takes precedence.

---

## Version History

| Version | Date       | Change Description |
|---------|------------|-------------------|
| 1.0     | 2026-02-09 | Initial ALM framework |

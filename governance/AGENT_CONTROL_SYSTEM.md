# MarcoERP – Agent Control System

**Deliverable 7: AI Agent Permissions, Validation Checklists, and Impact Analysis**

---

## 1. Control System Purpose

This document is the **operational manual** for any AI agent working on MarcoERP. It provides:

1. **Permissions matrix** — what the agent can and cannot do
2. **Pre-action validation checklist** — what must be verified before any action
3. **Impact analysis framework** — questions to answer before any feature
4. **Quality gates** — standards for all agent-generated output

This document works in conjunction with [AGENT_POLICY.md](AGENT_POLICY.md). If there is any conflict, AGENT_POLICY.md takes precedence.

## 3. Pre-Action Validation Checklist

Before creating or modifying ANY file, the agent must complete this checklist:

### 3.1 Architecture Validation

```
[ ] I have read ARCHITECTURE.md and understand layer responsibilities
[ ] This file belongs in layer: ___________
[ ] This file does not create forbidden cross-layer access
[ ] This file follows the namespace convention
[ ] This file follows the naming convention
[ ] This file's dependencies are allowed per ARCHITECTURE.md
[ ] Build order is preserved (no circular dependencies)
```

### 3.2 Financial Validation (if applicable)

```
[ ] Does this involve a financial entity or transaction? YES / NO

If YES:
[ ] Double-entry rule is enforced
[ ] Balance verification is in place
[ ] Posting workflow rules are followed
[ ] Period lock is checked before posting
[ ] VAT calculation is in the correct layer (Domain/Application)
[ ] No hardcoded financial amounts
[ ] All amounts use decimal type
[ ] Rounding is applied correctly
[ ] Audit log will capture this operation
```

### 3.3 Data Integrity Validation (if applicable)

```
[ ] Does this create or modify an entity? YES / NO

If YES:
[ ] Entity has all mandatory base columns (CreatedAt, RowVersion, etc.)
[ ] Soft delete is implemented for financial/master data
[ ] Hard delete is NOT used
[ ] Concurrency control (RowVersion) is present
[ ] Referential integrity is enforced
[ ] Timestamps are UTC
[ ] All string fields have MaxLength defined
```

### 3.4 UI Validation (if applicable)

```
[ ] Does this involve UI code? YES / NO

If YES:
[ ] Window binds to DTOs, not domain entities
[ ] No business logic in the window
[ ] No SQL or DbContext access in the window
[ ] Posted records are shown as read-only
[ ] Validation errors are displayed appropriately
[ ] Window follows UI_GUIDELINES.md layout
[ ] Control naming convention is followed
[ ] Confirmation dialog for destructive actions
```

### 3.5 Test Validation

```
[ ] Is this a new feature or change to existing feature? YES / NO

If YES:
[ ] Unit tests are written or updated
[ ] Test names follow convention: MethodName_Scenario_ExpectedResult
[ ] Tests are independent (no shared state)
[ ] Integration tests are considered if cross-layer logic is involved
[ ] Financial calculations have dedicated test coverage
```

## 5. Quality Gates for Agent Output

All agent-generated code must meet these standards before being presented:

### 5.1 Compilation Gate

```
[ ] Code compiles without errors
[ ] Code compiles without warnings
[ ] All using directives are necessary (no unused)
[ ] All referenced projects are in the allowed dependency list
```

### 5.2 Naming Gate

```
[ ] All classes use PascalCase
[ ] All methods use PascalCase
[ ] All variables use camelCase
[ ] All constants use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE or PascalCase (constant classes)
[ ] Boolean names are questions (IsValid, CanPost, HasBalance)
[ ] No abbreviations except standard ones (Id, VAT, AR, AP)
```

### 5.3 Documentation Gate

```
[ ] All public classes have XML documentation
[ ] All public methods have XML documentation
[ ] All public properties have XML documentation
[ ] Complex business rules have explanatory comments
[ ] No commented-out code
[ ] No TODO without description
```

### 5.4 Structure Gate

```
[ ] No class exceeds 500 lines
[ ] No method exceeds 50 lines
[ ] No method has more than 5 parameters
[ ] No nesting deeper than 3 levels
[ ] No static mutable state
[ ] No hardcoded strings, numbers, or configuration values
```

### 5.5 Pattern Compliance Gate

```
[ ] Follows established patterns in the codebase
[ ] Uses dependency injection (no direct instantiation)
[ ] Returns result types (not throwing exceptions for business logic)
[ ] Uses async/await where I/O is involved
[ ] Validates input at entry points
[ ] Uses guard clauses for preconditions
```

## 7. Agent Self-Check Questions

Before concluding any session, the agent asks itself:

| #  | Question                                                                |
|----|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1  | Did I check all relevant governance documents?                          |
| 2  | Did I violate any FORBIDDEN action?                                     |
| 3  | Did I propose where I should have instead of executing?                 |
| 4  | Did I document all assumptions?                                         |
| 5  | Did I leave any incomplete work without documenting it?                 |
| 6  | Did I create any technical debt?                                        |
| 7  | Would another developer understand what I did and why?                  |
| 8  | Is the system in a stable state after my changes?                       |
| 9  | Did I follow all quality gates?                                         |
| 10 | Did I provide a proper completion report?                               |

---

## 8. Emergency Stop Conditions

The agent must immediately stop and report if:

| Condition                                                                   |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Balance check fails in a way that can't be explained                        |
| Database migration would cause data loss                                     |
| Circular dependency is detected                                              |
| Required governance document is missing or contradictory                     |
| Authorization rules are unclear                                              |
| Financial calculation produces an unexpected result                          |
| Test suite starts failing after changes                                      |
| Layer boundary violation is discovered in existing code                      |
| Any action would cause permanent data corruption                             |
| Unclear whether an action is in EXECUTE, PROPOSE, or FORBIDDEN category     |

**In emergency stop, the agent must:**
1. Document exactly what was attempted
2. Document why it stopped
3. Document what state the code is in
4. Ask for human guidance
